UPDATE dyn_element_config SET INSTRUCTION = 'As part of our commitment to integrity, transparency, and accountability, all individuals acting on behalf of Kennedy Krieger —including faculty, staff, researchers, and administrators— are required to avoid situations that may present actual or perceived conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest arises when personal, financial, or other interests could compromise, or appear to compromise, one’s professional judgment or responsibilities to the Institute.\nTo uphold these standards:\n1. Individuals must disclose all relevant financial interests and external activities that may appear to intersect with their institutional responsibilities.\n2. Disclosure enables the Institute to assess whether a conflict exists and, if so, to determine appropriate steps for management, reduction, or elimination of the conflict.\n3. Importantly, the presence or appearance of a conflict does not imply wrongdoing, nor does it automatically preclude participation in the Institute’s activities. In many cases, conflicts can be effectively managed to preserve the integrity of research, teaching, and patient care.\n4.
